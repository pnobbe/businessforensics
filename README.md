# Software Development Assignment - Patrick Nobbe

## Configuring the settings

Edit the `appsettings.json` located in `src/Guesser.Client` to configure the game settings. A default `appsettings.json` has been included for convenience.

## Running the application

Make sure you have dotnet installed.

1. Open a command prompt in the root project folder and run `dotnet restore`.
2. In the same command prompt, run `dotnet run --project src/Guesser.Client`. This should start the application in the terminal.

Log files should appear in the root directory of the project.
